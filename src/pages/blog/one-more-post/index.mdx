## Look it's mdx

A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples
: Good for making applesauce.

oranges
: Citrus!

tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$
